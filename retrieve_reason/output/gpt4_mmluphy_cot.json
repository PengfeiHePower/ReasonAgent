In this case, the quantum efficiency is 0.1, which means that 10% of the photons are detected. If 100 photons are sent into the detector, then on average, 10% of these photons, or 10 photons, will be detected. The rms deviation is not given in the question, so we cannot determine it from the information provided. Therefore, the answer is that the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times, but we cannot determine the rms deviation."

Constructive interference occurs when the path difference is an integral multiple of the wavelength. In this case, the path difference is twice the thickness of the oil layer (since the light travels down and then up through the oil), or 1000 nm. The wavelength in the oil is the wavelength in vacuum divided by the index of refraction of the oil.

The elevator starts from rest and ends at rest, so its change in kinetic energy is zero. However, as it falls, it gains potential energy, which is converted into kinetic energy, and then this kinetic energy is converted into heat by the brakes. The potential energy gained by the elevator as it falls is given by m*g*h, where m is the mass of the elevator (1000 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height it falls (100 m). So, the heat that the brakes must dissipate is 1000 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 100 m = 980,000 J, which is closest to option C."

        "thought": "Let's think step by step. The payload will continue to move north at the same speed as the plane because there are no horizontal forces acting on it (assuming air resistance is neglected). This is due to Newton's first law of motion, which states that an object in motion will stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. In the vertical direction, the payload will accelerate downwards due to gravity. After 4.0 s, it will have a velocity of 4.0 s * 9.8 m/s^2 = 39.2 m/s, which is approximately 40 m/s. Therefore, the payload's velocity relative to the plane is both 100 m/s north (the same as the plane's velocity) and 40 m/s down (due to gravity)."
