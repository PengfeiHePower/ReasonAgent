Information about the careers of Giuseppe Verdi and Ambroise Thomas, particularly their connections to opera, form the core of the query.

The examination of their careers provides the necessary context about their works if they indeed composed operas, while the clarification of what an opera composer does, provides a lens through which to understand the nature of their work. The determination of their contributions to opera composing, along with examples of their works, offers the definitive proof needed to confirm them as opera composers."

To solve this, we need detailed information about these two individuals, especially in the context of their professional careers and their bodies of work. Without this information, we cannot fully address the main problem or its sub-questions.",
            "Given the available data, we can conclude that Giuseppe Verdi was an opera composer. However, the absence of information about Ambroise Thomas and his contributions to the opera scene negates a conclusive answer to the main problem. Supplementing this data with an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of an opera composer would further strengthen our analysis.",
            "Based on the available information, we can confidently affirm that both Verdi and Thomas were opera composers, as seen in their substantial bodies of work and their meaningful impacts on the opera scene in Italy and France, respectively. However, a more comprehensive understanding of what it means to be an opera composer would be beneficial."

He rose from a family of moderate means in Busseto, province of Parma, to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of fellow composers Gioachino Rossini, Vincenzo Bellini, and Gaetano Donizetti, whose works significantly influenced him. Verdi's early operas demonstrated a sympathy with the Risorgimento movement, which sought the unification of Italy, with the chorus \"Va, pensiero\" from his early opera Nabucco serving as a representative of these ideals. Verdi also briefly participated as an elected politician. Some of Verdi's most acclaimed works from his 'middle period' are Rigoletto, Il trovatore and La traviata. He is also known for his three late-life masterpieces: his Requiem, Otello, and Falstaff.",
