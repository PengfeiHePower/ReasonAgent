Protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane during the electron transport chain, and their flow back through ATP synthase is used to generate ATP, but this process is facilitated by the proton gradient, not direct active transport, making B incorrect. The final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain is oxygen, not NAD+, which is reduced to NADH early in the process, so C is incorrect. The fundamental principle of ATP synthesis is indeed the coupling of an exergonic reaction (the flow of electrons down the electron transport chain) with an endergonic one (the synthesis of ATP), validating D."

However, while mutations are a source of genetic variation, Darwin was not aware of mutations as we understand them today; he emphasized the existence of variation within populations without specifying the mechanism. The main source of variation in his view was the inherited differences that existed. Thus, (C) is not accurately described as a principle of Darwin's theory specifically, as he did not highlight mutations but rather worked with the concept of existing variations."

A higher concentration gradient (B) would increase the driving force for diffusion. Decreasing the number of different solutes (A) might reduce interference but doesn't directly enhance diffusion rate. Increasing the phospholipid to protein ratio (C) could increase membrane fluidity, aiding diffusion. Decreasing the membrane potential (D) affects charged particles, not uncharged solutes. Thus, option B is the most direct and effective way to increase the diffusion rate of an uncharged solute."

This is not due to genes moving into or out of the population (gene flow), nor is it natural selection because the storm did not selectively kill the fish based on their fitness. It's also not stabilizing selection since that would favor intermediate traits, maintaining the status quo. The sudden change due to a random event points to genetic drift, which can alter allele frequencies in small populations through chance events."

(B) A point mutation involves a change in a single nucleotide but does not necessarily alter the length significantly. (C) The primary RNA transcript is created through transcription and would be as long as the DNA template it was transcribed from, minus any introns if present. However, since it asks before splicing, it should be similar in length to the original DNA. (D) cDNA is synthesized from mature mRNA after splicing, which means it lacks introns and could potentially be shorter than the original DNA. But the question seems to focus on direct products without considering intron removal implications, implying cDNA would still represent the full length of the expressed region of the gene. Among these options, a point mutation would involve the change in the least number of nucleotides by definition."
