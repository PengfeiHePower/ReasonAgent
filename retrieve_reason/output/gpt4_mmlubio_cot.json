A deletion of a single nucleotide or a nucleotide triplet would cause a frameshift mutation, which would alter all the codons downstream and likely result in a nonfunctional protein. A single nucleotide substitution at the first or third position of a codon could potentially change the amino acid coded for, but the third position is often less critical due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Therefore, the most deleterious effect would likely result from a deletion of a single nucleotide, which would cause a frameshift mutation."

Karyotyping is a method of visualizing chromosomes, not a cause of genetic change. Balanced polymorphism is a situation where multiple alleles are maintained in a population, but it doesn't cause new variants. A mutation could cause a new variant, but it wouldn't necessarily result in reproductive isolation. Polyploidy, however, is a condition where an organism has more than two sets of chromosomes. This can occur spontaneously in plants and can result in reproductive isolation, as the polyploid plants can only successfully reproduce with other polyploids. Therefore, the most likely cause of the new variant in the fern population is polyploidy."

The simplest explanation for the inheritance of these colors in chickens would be that the gray color is a result of incomplete dominance, where neither the black nor the white trait is completely dominant over the other. This would result in the gray phenotype when both traits are present. Therefore, the traits for black and white color demonstrate incomplete dominance."

Protons are not pumped through ATP synthase by active transport, they flow through it by passive transport, so option B is incorrect. The final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain is not NAD+, it's oxygen, so option C is incorrect. ATP is indeed formed because an endergonic reaction (ADP + Pi -> ATP) is coupled with an exergonic reaction (such as the flow of protons through ATP synthase), so option D is correct."

These include the idea that evolution is a gradual process that occurs over a long period of time (Option A), that there is significant variation within every population (Option B), and that organisms will overpopulate an area, leading to competition (Option D). However, while mutations can contribute to variation within a population, they are not considered the main source of all variation according to Darwin's theory. Instead, Darwin emphasized the role of heritable variation and differential survival and reproduction, not the specific mechanisms of genetic mutation. Therefore, Option C is not part of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection."

Darwin's theory of evolution suggests that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. Therefore, the more closely related two different organisms are, the more recently they shared a common ancestor. This is because they would have diverged from this common ancestor at a more recent point in evolutionary history. So, the correct answer is Option C."

Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. Genetic drift is the change in the frequency of an existing gene variant in a population due to random sampling of organisms. Stabilizing selection is a type of natural selection in which genetic diversity decreases as the population stabilizes on a particular trait value. In this scenario, a thunderstorm has caused a disproportionate number of long-finned fish to die, altering the relative frequency of long-finned and short-finned fish. This is a random event that has caused a change in the gene frequency in the population, which aligns with the definition of genetic drift. Therefore, the correct answer is Option C."

Symbiosis is a broad term that includes any type of close and long-term biological interaction between two different biological organisms, be it mutualistic, parasitic, or commensal. Commensalism, on the other hand, is a relationship where one organism benefits while the other is unaffected. Therefore, the correct answer is Option C (Commensalism)."

A single strand of the original DNA segment (Option A) and a single strand of the original DNA segment after a point mutation (Option B) would contain the same number of nucleotides, as a point mutation simply changes one nucleotide for another, but does not add or remove nucleotides. The primary RNA transcript (Option C) would contain more nucleotides than the original DNA segment, as it includes both exons and introns. A single strand of complementary DNA (cDNA) made from the original DNA (Option D) would contain fewer nucleotides than the primary RNA transcript, as it only includes exons (introns are removed during the creation of cDNA). Therefore, the molecule with the fewest number of nucleotides would be either Option A or Option B. Since the question asks for the molecule with the 'fewest' number of nucleotides, and a point mutation does not add or remove nucleotides, the answer is Option B."
